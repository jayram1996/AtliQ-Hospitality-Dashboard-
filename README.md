🏨 AtliQ Grands – Hospitality Business Intelligence Dashboard
📌 Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands is a well-established chain of five-star hotels across India, operating for over 20 years. Recently, they have been losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment 
due to rising competition and ineffective decision-making at the management level.

To reverse this trend, the Managing Director aims to integrate Business and Data Intelligence into their operations. However, due to the absence of an in-house analytics team,
the Revenue Management Team has outsourced this task to a third-party analytics provider.

🎯 Objective
As a data analyst, I was tasked with:

Building custom metrics as per stakeholder requirements.

Designing an interactive Power BI dashboard based on a mock-up.
    
Extracting key business insights beyond the requested metrics to support strategic decisions.

📊 Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard includes the following views:

👔 Executive Summary – High-level insights for top-level management.

📅 Booking Analysis – Trends in lead time, cancellation, and booking channels.

💰 Revenue Analysis – Deep dive into revenue performance across time and segments.
